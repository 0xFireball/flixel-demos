Haxe Version of "Jumper"

"Jumper" has been created by Chipacabra as a tutorial on developing a Flash game with flixel (http://chipacabra.blogspot.com/2011/02/project-jumper-part-12-odds-and-ends.html), then it was ported to Jangaroo (https://github.com/fwienber/jumper), and I ported it haxe to test my port of FLixel.
